# Homework 01 - HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

For this weeks homework, we needed to refactor a website to ensure it was accessibility friendly and optimized for search engines. 

Following the user story, I made a series of changes to the website in order to meet the necessary criteria. These changes included:

- Giving the webpage a descriptive title.
- Ensuring all the broken links were corrected and working.
- Giving the image it's own tag, rather than putting it in the CSS.
- Grouping some of the 'Class' elements together which incorporated the same styling.
- Ensuring all 'h' tags followed sequential order.
- Spacing and tabbing the necessary HTML tags for a cleaner code.
- Ensuring all the images were given ALT attributes.
- Changing the order of the CSS to ensure it flows the same as the HTML.
- Leaving comments on the stylesheet.
